/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for NextVerse Education platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a hybrid security model: User data is strictly owned by each user, while course and topic data is publicly accessible.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Course information, publicly readable.
 * - /courses/{courseId}/topics/{topicId}: Topic information, publicly readable.
 * - /courses/{courseId}/topics/{topicId}/quiz: Quiz information, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/courseProgress/{userCourseProgressId}: User's course progress, accessible only by the owning user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Course and topic data is publicly readable to facilitate discovery.
 * - UserCourseProgress is private to each user.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Authorization checks are performed without `get()` calls to other documents. All necessary information for authorization is either present in the `request.auth` context or within the document being accessed.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public and private data are stored in separate top-level collections to simplify access control. Courses and topics are public; user profiles and course progress are private.
